# 🚀 Volume Ghost – Automated Token Launch & Simulation Bot for Solana

**Volume Ghost** is a powerful, end-to-end automation tool for creating and boosting new tokens on Solana.  
Designed to simulate organic activity, build hype, and help tokens gain early traction on platforms like [pump.fun](https://pump.fun), this bot handles wallet creation, token distribution, fake volume generation, and more – all with Telegram control.
